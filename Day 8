### Practice Questions:

1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
select upper(name) from patients;

2. Find the length of each staff member's name.
select length(staff_name) from staff;

3. Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.
select role ,concat(staff_id ,' - ', staff_name) as staff_code from staff;

### Daily Challenge:

**Question:**
Question: Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, age category (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), and name length. Only show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    UPPER(name) AS full_name_upper,
    LOWER(service) AS service_lower,
    CASE 
        WHEN age >= 65 THEN 'Senior'
        WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
        ELSE 'Minor'
    END AS age_category,
    LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM patients
WHERE LENGTH(name) > 10;
