### Practice Questions:

1. Count the number of patients by each service.
select service,count(*) as patients_count from patients group by service;

2. Calculate the average age of patients grouped by service.
select service ,avg(age) as avg_age from patients group by service;

3. Find the total number of staff members per role.
select role, count(*)  as total_count from staff_schedule group by role;

### Daily Challenge:

**Question:** For each hospital service, calculate the total number of patients admitted, total patients refused, and the admission rate (percentage of requests that were admitted). Order by admission rate descending.
SELECT
    service,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Admitted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_admitted,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Refused' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_refused,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Admitted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 /
        COUNT(*),
    2) AS admission_rate_percent
FROM patients
GROUP BY service
ORDER BY admission_rate_percent DESC;
