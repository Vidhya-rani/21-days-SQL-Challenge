## Practice Questions:

1. Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
select week from services_weekly where event is null; 

2. Count how many records have null or empty event values.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NULL 
   OR event = '';

3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.
SELECT DISTINCT service
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NOT NULL AND event <> '';

## Daily Challenge:

**Question:**
Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order by average patient satisfaction descending.
SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN event IS NULL OR event = '' THEN 'No Event'
        ELSE 'With Event'
    END AS event_status,
    COUNT(*) AS week_count,
    AVG(patient_satisfaction) AS avg_patient_satisfaction,
    AVG(staff_morale) AS avg_staff_morale
FROM services_weekly
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN event IS NULL OR event = '' THEN 'No Event'
        ELSE 'With Event'
    END
ORDER BY avg_patient_satisfaction DESC;
